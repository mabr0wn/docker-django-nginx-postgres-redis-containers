[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a containerization tool used for spinning up isolated, reproducible application enviroments. **This piece details how to containerize a Django Project, Postgres, and Redis for local development along with delivering the stack to the cloud via** [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Docker Machine](http://docs.docker.com/machine/)


In the end, the stack will include a separate container for each service:

- 1 web/Django container
- 1 nginx container
- 1 Postgres container
- 1 Redis container
- 1 data container

### Updates:
- *11/10/2017*: Added named data volumes to the Postgres and Redis containers.
- *11/13/2017*: Added Docker Toolbox, and also updated to the latest versions of Docker - Docker client(17.09.0-ce, build afdb6d4), Docker composer (v1.16.1, build 6d1ac21), Docker Machine(v0.12.2, build 9371605)

## Local Setup
Along with Docker(v17.09.0) we will be using -
  - [Docker Compose](v1.16.1) for orchestrating a multi-container application into a single app, and
  - [Docker Machine](v0.12.2) for creating Docker hosts both locally and in the cloud.
  
If you're running either Mac OS X or Windows, then download and install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) to get all the necessary tools. Otherwise follow the directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) to install Docker Compose and Machine, respectively.

Once done, test out the installs:

    $ docker-machine version
    docker-machine version 0.12.2, build 9371605
    $ docker-compose version
    docker-compose version 1.16.1, build 6d1ac21
    docker-py version: 2.5.1
    CPython version: 2.7.12
    OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j 26 Sep 2016
    

Next clone the project from the [repository](https://github.com/mattd429/Django-Docker) or create your own project based on the project structure found on the repo:

We're now ready to get the containers up and runnning...

## Docker Machine
To start Docker Machine, simply navigate to the project root and then run:

    $ docker-mahcine create - d virtualbox dev;
    Running pre-create checks...
    Creating machine...
    (dev) Creating VirtualBox VM...
    (dev) Creating SSH key...
    (dev) Starting the VM...
    (dev) Check network to re-create if needed...
    (dev) Waiting for an IP...
    Waiting for machine to be running, this may take a few minutes...
    Detecting operating system of created instance...
    Waiting for SSH to be available...
    Detecting the provisioner...
    Provisioning with boot2docker...
    Copying certs to the local machine directory...
    Copying certs to the remote machine...
    Setting Docker configuration on the remote daemon...
    Checking connection to Docker...
    Docker is up and running!
    To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine
    running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env dev
    
The `create` command set up a new "Machine" (called *dev*) for Docker development. In essence, it started a VM with the Docker client running. Now just point at the *dev* machine:

```docker
$ eval $(docker-machine env dev)
```

Run the following command to view the currently running Machines:

    $ docker-machine ls
    NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
    dev    *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.10.3
    
Next, let's fire up the container with Docker Compose and get Django, Postgres, and Redis up and running.

## Docker Compose
Let's take a look at the *docker-compose.yml* file:

```yml
web:
  restart: always
  build: ./web
  expose:
   - "8000"
  links:
   - postgres:postgres
   - redis:redis
  volumes:
   - /usr/src/app
   - /usr/src/app/static
  env_file: .env
  command: /usr/local/bin/gunicorn django_docker.wsgi:application -w 2 -b :8000
 
nginx:
  restart: always
  build: ./nginx/
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - /www/static
  volumes_from:
    - web
  links:
    - web:web
  
postgres:
  restart: always
  image: postgres:lastest
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes:
    - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    
regis:
  restart: always
  image: redis:latest
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
  volumes:
    - redisdata:/data
```

Here, we're defining four services - *web*, *nginx*, *postgres*, and *redis*.

1. First, the *web* service is built via the instructions in the *Dockerfile* within the "web" directory
 - Where the Python environment is setup, requirements are installed, and Django applications is fired up on port 8000. That port is then fowarded to port 80 on the host environment - e.g., the Docker Machine. This service also adds environment variables to the container that are defined in the *.env* file.

2. The *nginx* service is used for reverse proxy to proxy to foward requests either to Django or the static file directory.
3. Next, the *postgres* service is built from the official [PostgresSQL image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), which installs Postgres and runs the server on the default port 5432. Did you notice the [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/volumes/)? This helps ensure that the data persists even if the Postgres container is deleted.
4. Likewise, the *redis* service uses the official [Redis image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/redis/) to install Redis and then the service is ran on port 6379.

Now, to get the containers running, build the images and then start the services:

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up -d
    

This will take a while the first time you run it.  Subsequent builds run much quicker since Docker [caches](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) the results from the first build.

Once the services are running, we need to create the database migrations:

    $ docker-compose run web /usr/local/bin/python manage.py migrate
    
Grab the IP associated with Docker Machine -`docker-machine ip dev`- and then navigate to that IP in your browser:

![alt text](https://realpython.com/images/blog_images/dockerizing-django/django-on-docker.png)

Try refreshing. You should see the counter update. Essentially, we're using the [Redis INCR](http://redis.io/commands/incr) to increment after each handled request. Check out the code in *web/django_docker/apps/todo/views.py* for more info.

Again, this created four services, all running in different containers:

    $ docker-compose ps
            Name                          Command               State           Ports
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    dockerizingdjango_nginx_1      /usr/sbin/nginx                  Up      0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
    dockerizingdjango_postgres_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh postgres   Up      0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
    dockerizingdjango_redis_1      /entrypoint.sh redis-server      Up      0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp
    dockerizingdjango_web_1        /usr/local/bin/gunicorn do ...   Up      8000/tcp

To see which environment variables are available on the *web* service, run:

    $ docker-compose run web env
    
To view the logs:

    $ docker-compose logs
      
You can also enter the Postgres Shell - since we fowarded the port to this host environment in the *docker-compose.yml* file - to add users/roles as well as databases via:

    $ psql - h 192.168.99.100 -p 5342 -U postgres --password

Ready to deploy? Stop the processes via `docker-compose stop` and let's get the app up in the cloud!

### Deployment

So, with our app running locally, we can now push this exact same environment to a cloud hosting provider with Docker Machine.  Let's deploy to a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d8f211a4b4c2) box.

After you [sign up](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d8f211a4b4c2) for Digital Ocean, generate a [Personal Access Token](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2), and then run the following command:

```
$ docker-machine create \
-d digitalocean \
--digitalocean-access-token=ADD_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
production
```

This will take a few minutes to provision the droplet and setup a new Docker Machine called *production*:

```
Running pre-create checks...
Creating machine...
(production) Creating SSH key...
(production) Creating Digital Ocean droplet...
(production) Waiting for IP address to be assigned to the Droplet...
Waiting for machine to be running, this may take a few minutes...
Machine is running, waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting operating system of created instance...
Detecting the provisioner...
Provisioning with ubuntu(systemd)...
Installing Docker...
Copying certs to the local machine directory...
Copying certs to the remote machine...
Setting Docker configuration on the remote daemon...
Checking connection to Docker...
Docker is up and running!
To see how to connect Docker to this machine, run: docker-machine env production
```

Now we have two machines urnnin, one locally and one on Digital Ocean:

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME         ACTIVE   DRIVER         STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER   ERRORS
dev          *        virtualbox     Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.10.3
production   -        digitalocean   Running   tcp://45.55.35.188:2376             v1.10.3
```

Set *production* as the active machine and load the Docker environment into the shell:

```
$ eval "$(docker-machine env production)"
```

Finally, let's build the Django app again in the cloud. This time we need to use a slightly different Docker Compose file that does not mount a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/) in the container.  Why? Well, the volume is perfect for local development since we can update our local code in the "web" directory and the changes will immediately take affect in the container. In production, there's no need for this, obviously.

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose -f production.yml up -d
$ docker-compose run web /usr/local/bin/python manager.py migrate
```

> Did you notice how we specified a different config file for production? 
> what if you wanted to also run [collectstatic](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#collectstatic)?  See this [issue](https://github.com/realpython/dockerizing-django/issues/13).


Grab the IP address associated with that Digital Ocean account and view it in the browser. If all went well, you should see your app running, as it should.

### Conclusion
 - Grab the code from the [repo](https://github.com/realpython/dockerizing-django) (star it too).
 - Need a Chanllenge? Try using [extends](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) to clean up the repetitive code in the two Docker Compose configuration files. Keep it DRY!
 - Have a great day!
